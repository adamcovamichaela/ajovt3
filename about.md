# Lukas Hunter


*Optimistic designer. I like to solve problems through the process of searching for new ways on how to solve key issues.*

* My name is Lukas Hunter. I grew up in Prague to a Czech mother and a Canadian father. 
I tend to be pretty reversed but give me a beer and I will turn into a wild beast, that likes to dance. 
I play tennis and go for walks in the nature. My dominant source of inspiration is symbolism in vexillology. 

* Iâ€™m interested in vexillology, because it's unique semiotic language can give us a new perception on how to view graphic design. Through my study of flag design, I like to find simple minimalist ways for creating visual graphics.
